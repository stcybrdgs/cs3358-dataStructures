ASG06 / PART01

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to develop a function capable of combining the contents of two separate linked lists into a single linked list with the following properties:
- the final data set is sorted in monotonically increasing order
- the final data set alternates odd and even values until alternating is no longer possible
- duplicate values are juxtaposed to maintain the property of monotonically increasing order

DESCRIPTION:
The instructor provided all files
My challenge was to develop the void function 'InterleaveOddsAndEvensInOrigOrder(Node*)' in the file 'llcplmp.cpp'
The 'Makefile' produces an executable that runs an automated test and produces the results file 'a5p1test.out'
The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
