#PART01

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to develop a sort/merge function capable of operating on linked lists using recursion. 

DESCRIPTION:
- The instructor provided all files
- My challenge was to develop the void function 'SortedMergeRecur(Node*& xHead, Node*& yHead, Node*& zHead)' in the file 'llcplmp.cpp'.
- The 'Makefile' produces an executable called 'a6p1' that runs an automated test and generates 'a6p1test.out'

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
