#PART02

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this assignment was to implement three recursive functions for operating on polynomials.

DESCRIPTION:
- The instructor provided 'Assign06P2.cpp' and the 'Makefile'
- My challenge was to develop the three recursive functions contained in ['Assign06P2.cpp'](Assign06P2.cpp)
- The 'Makefile' produces an executable called 'a6p2' that runs an automated test

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
