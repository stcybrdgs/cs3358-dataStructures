#ASG07

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a queue using a heap as the underlying data structure.

DESCRIPTION:
- The instructor provided 'Assign07Test.cpp', 'DPQueue.h', the print functions in 'DPQueue.cpp', and the Makefiles
- My challenge was to develop ['DPQueue.cpp'](DPQueue.cpp) (except for the print functions, which were already implemented)
- 'Makefile' produces an executable called 'a7' that allows for manual, interactive testing of the program
- 'MakefileAutoDOS' produces an executable calle 'a7a' that runs an automated test on the program
- 'a7test.out' captures the shell output from the automated test

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
