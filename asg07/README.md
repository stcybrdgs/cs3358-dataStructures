OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a queue using a heap as the underlying data structure.

DESCRIPTION:
- The instructor provided all program files
- My challenge was to develop 'DPQueue.cpp' with the exception of the print functinos, which were already implemented
- The 'Makefile' produces an executable called 'a7' that allows for manual, interactive testing of the program
- The 'MakefileAutoDOS' produces an executable calle 'a7a' that runs an automated test on the program
- 'a7test.out' captures the shell output of the automated test

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
