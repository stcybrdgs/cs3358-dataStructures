ASG02

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class to hold and operate on a set of integers. This assignment is essentially the same as asg01, but it's key data structure is a DYNAMIC ARRAY rather than a STATIC ARRAY.

DESCRIPTION: 
- The instructor provided 'Assign02.cpp' and 'IntSet.h'
- My challenge was to develop 'IntSet.cpp'
- 'a2testSCB.in' was used to expedite testing
- The program output was recorded in the OUT file (a2testSCB.out).

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
