#ASG02

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class containing data and methods for a set of integers in a dynamic array. This assignment is essentially the same as asg01, but it's key data structure is a DYNAMIC ARRAY rather than a STATIC ARRAY.

DESCRIPTION: 
- The instructor provided 'Assign02.cpp' and 'IntSet.h'
- **My challenge was to develop ['IntSet.cpp'](IntSet.cpp)**
- 'a2testSCB.in' was used to expedite testing
- 'a2testSCB.out' contains the program output resulting from 'a2testSCB.out' 

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
