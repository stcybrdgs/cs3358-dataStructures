ASG02

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class to hold and operate on a set of integers. This assignment is essentially the same as asg01, but it's key data structure is a DYNAMIC ARRAY rather than a STATIC ARRAY.

DESCRIPTION: 
The instructor provided the driver (Assign02.cpp) and the header (IntSet.h) files. 
My challenge was to build out the implementation file (IntSet.cpp). 
A data IN File (a2testSCB.in) was used to expedite testing. 
The program output was recorded in the OUT file (a2testSCB.out).

REQUIREMENTS: 
Generally speaking, the class is required to hold a set of integers in a dynamic array, and its member methods are required to provide for the following data manipulations:
- compare two class objects
- subtract one object from another
- print the contents of the set of integers
- search the set
- confirm if one object is a subset of another
- create a union of two objects
- create an intersection of two objects
- modify the set by inserting, resetting, or removing integers

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
