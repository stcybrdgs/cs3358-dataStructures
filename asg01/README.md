ASG01

The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class to hold and operate on a set of integers, where the data container is a static array, and the methods allow for the following data manipulation:
- compare two class objects
- subtract one object from another
- print the contents of the set of integers
- search the set
- confirm if one object is a subset of another
- create a union of two objects
- create an intersection of two objects
- modify the set by inserting, resetting, or removing integers

The instructor provided the driver (Assign01.cpp) and the header (IntSet.h) files. 

My challenge was to build out the implementation file (IntSet.cpp).
