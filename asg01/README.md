ASG01

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class containing data and methods for a set of integers in a static array.

DESCRIPTION:
- 'Assign01.cpp' and 'IntSet.h' were provided by the instructor
- My challenge was to develop 'IntSet.cpp' 
- 'a1test.in' was used to expedite testing. 
- 'a1test.out' contains the program output resulting from 'a1test.in'

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
