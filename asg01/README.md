ASG01

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class to hold and operate on a set of integers. 

DESCRIPTION:
The instructor provided the driver (Assign01.cpp) and the header (IntSet.h) files. 
My challenge was to build out the implementation file (IntSet.cpp).
A data IN File (a1test.in)  was used to expedite testing. 
The program output was recorded in the OUT file (a1test.out).

REQUIREMENTS:
Generally speaking, the class is required to hold a set of integers in a static array, and its member methods are required to provide for the following data manipulations:
- compare two class objects
- subtract one object from another
- print the contents of the set of integers
- search the set
- confirm if one object is a subset of another
- create a union of two objects
- create an intersection of two objects
- modify the set by inserting, resetting, or removing integers

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
