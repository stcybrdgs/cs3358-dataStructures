ASG05/ PART02

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a queue using two stacks. The queue is based on a custom class, and the stacks are provided from the STL stack template.

DESCRIPTION:
- the instructor provided all files with the exception of 'cnPtrQueue.cpp'
- my challenge was to develop the 'cnPtrQueue.cpp' implementation
- 'a5p2_test.in' was used to test my implementation using canned inputs
- 'a5p2_test.out' contains the output produced by running the program with 'a5p2_test.in'

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
