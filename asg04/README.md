ASG04

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a namespace and class template for a set of generic data types contained in a static array.

DESCRIPTION: 
The instructor provided the driver (Assign03.cpp) and the header (Sequence.h) files. 
My challenge was to build out the implementation file (Sequence.cpp). 
The driver Assign03.cpp provides for a manual, interactive testing of the program, while the driver Assign03Auto.cpp provides for a more thorough, non-interactive test based on pre-determined use cases. 

REQUIREMENTS: 
Generally speaking, the class is required to hold a sequence of values in a dynamic array, and its member methods are required to provide for the following data manipulations:
- resize the sequence container
- iterate to the front of the sequence
- iterate to the next index in the sequence
- insert a value before the current index
- attach a value after the current index 
- remove a target value from the sequence
- set one sequence equal to another (overloaded assignment)

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
