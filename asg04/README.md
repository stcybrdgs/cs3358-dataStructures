#ASG04

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a namespace and class template for a set of generic data types contained in a static array.

DESCRIPTION:
- The instructor provided 'sequenceTest.cpp' and 'sequence.h'
- My challenge was to develop 'sequence.template' 
- I used 'a4test.in' to test my template with canned inputs 
- 'a4test.out' contains the program output resulting from 'a4test.in'
- I also ran a manual test and captured the results in 'a4testInteractive.out'

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
