ASG03

OBJECTIVE: 
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a class containing data and methods for a sequence of values. The key data structure is a dynamic array.

DESCRIPTION: 
- The instructor provided 'Assign03.cpp' and 'Sequence.h'
- My challenge was to develop 'Sequence.cpp' 
- 'Assign03.cpp' was used to perform interactive testing of the program
- 'Assign03Auto.cpp' was used to perform a non-interactive test with pre-defined use cases

The details around pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are captured by the documentation that is included in each of the program files.
