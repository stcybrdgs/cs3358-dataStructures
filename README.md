#cs3358-dataStructures

This repo contains C++ assignments from a Data Structures class taught at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

DESCRIPTION OF ASSIGNMENTS:
- asg01: implements a class for a set of integers in a static array
- asg02: implements a class for a set of integers in a dynamic array
- asg03: implements a class for a sequence of values in a dynamic array
- asg04: implements a namespace and class template for generic data types in a static array 
- asg05: part01 implements a queue using two stacks created from the STL stack template
- asg05: part02 implements a function to interleave and sort data from two linked lists into one
- asg06: part01 implements a sort/merge function using recursion
- asg06: part02 implements three recursive functions for operating on polynomials
- asg07: implements a queue using a heap as the underlying data structure

These descriptions are high-level only. More details are provided in the README.md file within each assignment folder.
